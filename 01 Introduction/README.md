Hi Self-Driving enthusiast,

Attached to this lesson I provide you with all the relevant material that I will use during the course: code, 3D models of the robot, a list of components that you need to buy if you want to create your robot, course slides, notes, insights, pdf, my car‚Äôs keys üòÇ

If you are looking for something you‚Äôll find it in the resources attached to this lesson and if you don‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for, then I apologize in advance because probably I forgot to include it. So go to the Q&A section below and ask me for the missing attachments.

Here you will find all the code that we are going to develop during the course and here I‚Äôll fix all the bugs that you will kindly report to me (and where I‚Äôll add some new ones üôÇ)

[Github](https://github.com/AntoBrandi/Self-Driving-and-ROS-2-Learn-by-Doing-Map-Localization)

Here you will find the CAD and STL models of the robot components:

Here you can find the STL files to feed your 3D Printer üñ®Ô∏è

Here you will find the list of components needed to assemble the robot, the sensors, and the electronic parts. I added some like where you can buy the components (I‚Äôm not affiliated with these stores, so I‚Äôm not earning anything from these purchases üòî then buy from the store you prefer)
